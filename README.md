Helper files to post-process .csv files from Keysight Sensor Management Tool .csv Export Tool. To use, add .csv files to the MATLAB working directory,
define the file name in line 3 of either script, and hit run. KeysightRFTDOALocalization.m is for post-processing results from a stationary tower and 
KeysightRFTDOALocalizationforFlights.m is for UAV flights. MergeLocalizationData.ipynb helps to merge the .csv file from the Keysight N6854 Export tool and the vehicleOut.txt files from the AERPAW file. It adds the ground truth Lat/Long coordinates and the altitude from the vehicleOut.txt file to all the other information provided in the Keysight N6854 Export .csv file.
